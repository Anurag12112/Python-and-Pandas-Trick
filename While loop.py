#While loop is useto repeat a block of code multiple time as per our requirement
count = 5 
while count <= 10: #0<5
    #this indentation is important it indicates the body of loop
    print(count)                 #1st loop run
    #the loops runs three more times when count is equal 2,3 and 4 increasing the value of count in each iteration of the loop
    count = count+ 1 #this line added incrementing value of count by one it's initial valueis zero it's new value is 1
